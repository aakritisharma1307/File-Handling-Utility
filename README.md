## DESCRIPTION OF PROGRAM : 
This project is a Java File Handling Utility, which I created using Eclipse IDE. The main purpose of this program is to perform basic file operations like creating, writing, reading, appending, and modifying text files. It is menu-driven, so when the program runs, it shows the user different options, and based on the choice, it performs that file operation.
To build this, I used Java I/O classes. For example, I used the File class to create and manage files, FileWriter and BufferedWriter to write data into files, and FileReader and BufferedReader to read data from files. I also used the Scanner class to take input from the user. Since working with files often causes errors like file not found or permission denied, I added try-catch blocks for exception handling so the program doesn’t crash and shows proper messages.
The program has four main features. First, it can write data into a file, either by creating a new file or overwriting the old content. Second, it can read data line by line and display it on the screen. Third, it can append data, which means adding new information without deleting the old content. And fourth, it can modify data, where specific content of the file can be updated. These features make the program flexible because you can store information, read it anytime, and even update it when required.
There are many uses for this program. For example, personally, it can be used like a simple notepad to store reminders, notes, or logs. In schools or colleges, it can be used to keep track of student records like grades and attendance before moving to databases. Small businesses can use it for inventory lists, billing notes, or customer details. Developers can test data storage with this program before implementing bigger databases. Even system administrators can use such a tool for quickly editing files or managing logs.
Overall, this project really helped me understand how file handling works in Java. It taught me how to use I/O classes, how to manage user input, and how to handle exceptions properly. Even though it looks simple, it can actually be very useful in real-life situations. So, I’d say this is a small but practical program that shows the basics of Java file handling in an easy way.
